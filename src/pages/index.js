				In the XI century. Once a powerful Armenian state, which for a long time exerted a strong influence on politics in Transcaucasia and Western Asia, it was conquered by the Seljuk Turks, who included it in their sultanate. Since then, for half a millennium, the Armenians, with the exception of those who lived separately from the main part of the ethnos in Cilicia in the east of the Mediterranean, lost their own statehood, although from time to time, small Armenian fiefdoms dependent on the Turkic and Iranian authorities appeared in Transcaucasia. The power in the Armenian lands changed from time to time. In the XII - XIII centuries. part of historical Armenia was taken away from the Seljuks by the Georgian kingdom, which then entered its heyday. In the XIII century. Another part of Armenia was conquered by the Khorezmshah - a descendant of the rulers of the Khorezm region in Central Asia, Jalalu-d-Din, and then in the same century the entire territory of Armenia, like all the Transcaucasia, was captured by the Mongols. In the XV century. Armenia came under the rule of the Turkmen tribal unions, and in the 16th century. the founder of the Safavid monarchy, Ismail Shah, which included Azerbaijan, Iran and part of Central Asia, won it from the Turkmen. By that time, a powerful Turkic state, the Ottoman Empire, had formed in Asia Minor, which was rapidly expanding its borders, capturing vast areas in Europe and the Middle East. The Ottomans managed to conquer the western part of Armenia from the Safavids. In addition, the Ottomans conquered Cilician Armenia in the south of Asia Minor. Since then, for three hundred years, the Armenian lands of Transcaucasia have become the subject of constant redistribution between the Ottoman Empire and the successive dynasties of Iranian rulers. For the population of Armenia, these wars became a real disaster: the Armenians had to constantly support the Iranian and Ottoman troops who came to their territory, moreover, during the war, the warring parties, according to the old custom, robbed and enslaved the population in the enemy's possessions. In peacetime, the Armenians were also not a full-fledged part of the population of the Iranian and Ottoman empires: as gentiles, they did not have the right to hold major government posts and were obliged to pay a special tax in exchange for the patronage of the state. Also, the Armenian population was obliged to supply boys and youths for training in the guards corps of the shahs and sultans: the young people brought up there were replenished with the personal troops of the Iranian and Ottoman rulers who served as the main pillar of the throne. To strengthen control over the border areas, the Iranian authorities practiced forced resettlement of Armenians deep within their state and the settlement of Armenia by Persians, Turks and Kurds. Gradually, the indigenous population became a minority in Eastern Armenia.

						Since the beginning of the XIX century. in Transcaucasia, the positions of the Russian Empire are strengthening, the treaty on whose protectorate was concluded back in 1783 by the Georgian king Irakli II. In 1801, Russian troops entered Georgia, and most of it was incorporated into Russia. In 1804, the Russian-Iranian war began, during which almost all of Eastern Armenia was captured by Russia. However, under the terms of the Gulistan Peace of 1813, the Armenian territories were returned to Iran. In 1816, General A. Ermolov was appointed commander of the separate Georgian (Caucasian) corps, i.e., the Russian troops stationed in the Caucasus. He also received the authority to manage local civil affairs, actually becoming the sovereign governor of the Russian Emperor Alexander I. Under him, the direct control of the Russian administration in the Caucasus is strengthened.

						The Azerbaijani khanates, which remained independent in their internal affairs and became vassal to Russia, were abolished, and a significant part of the population of which were Armenians. Russian citizenship looked more attractive to the Armenians than Iranian. The Armenians were Christians, although to a large extent of a different persuasion than the Orthodox Russians, so it was easier for them to find a common language with the Russian governors. The support of the Armenian population played a decisive role in the consolidation of Russia in the South Transcaucasus: the result of the new Russian-Iranian war of 1826-1829. the annexation to Russia of the territories that were in vassal dependence on the Qajar dynasty of the Erivan and Nakhichevan khanates, about a third of whose population were Armenians (Turkmanchay world). By the decree of Emperor Nicholas I of March 21, 1828, a new administrative unit was formed in their place - the Armenian region, ruled by Russian officials.

						Then a kind of "exchange" of population took place between Russia and Iran: about 30 thousand Armenians were repatriated from Iran to the Armenian region, and Persians and Turks massively migrated from the Armenian region to Iran and the Ottoman Empire. About 25 thousand Armenians of Western Armenia moved from the territory of the Ottoman Empire to the Armenian region. As a result, Armenians made up the majority of the population of the Armenian region. In the 40s. XIX century. the government of Nicholas I began to reorganize the system of governance in Transcaucasia, where administrative units began to be created according to the all-Russian model: provinces and districts. In 1840, the Armenian region was abolished, its territory was included in the Tiflis province, which had the center of the Georgian city of Tiflis (Tbilisi). In 1849, on the former territory of the Armenian region, by separating the Erivan, Nakhichevan and Alexandropol districts from the Tiflis province, as well as small territories from the Shemakha province, the Erivan province was formed, the administrative center of which was the ancient city of Erivan (Yerevan). Erivan province, in which most of the Russian Armenians lived, existed until 1917. In it, the Armenians constituted about 53% of the population. Azerbaijanis were less numerous (37 - 38%). Also, some of the population were Kurds and Russian settlers.{"\n\n"}

						Erivan, Alexandropol, Nakhichevan, Novobayazetsky, Surmalinsky, Sharur-Daralagez, Echmiadzinsky. In the Alexandropol, Novobayazet and Etchmiadzin districts, Armenians in 1897 accounted for more than half of the population (in Alexandropol 85.5%). In Sharuro-Daralagez, Nakhichevan and Erivan districts, Azerbaijanis had a small numerical superiority. The governor of Erivan was governed by a governor appointed by the Russian government, who, in turn, was subordinate to the Caucasian governor who had almost tsarist powers in the entrusted territory (from 1881 to 1905 - the chief of the Caucasian administration). Prior to 1896, the highest military officials of the Caucasian army were appointed governors of Erivan; he first held this position in 1849 - 1859. Major General Ivan Nazorov, who was replaced by Major General Mikhail Astafiev. The last two governors of Erivan: actual state councilor Vladimir Tizengauzen (1896 - 1916) and court councilor Arkady Strelbitsky (1916 - 1917), were civil servants. In 1871, a peasant reform was carried out in Armenia by decree of the Russian government, the main essence of which was the abolition of serfdom. In the course of it, the Armenian peasants who remained in personal dependence on the Azerbaijani feudal lords who had lost their political power but owned vast estates, the Armenian peasants were freed, which finally ended the traditional inequality of the Christian population. The borders of the Erivan province roughly coincided with the borders of the modern Republic of Armenia. Most of its territory was occupied by the eastern part of the Armenian Highlands - a vast volcanic plateau, separated by deep river valleys and bordered by narrow mountain ranges. The northern part of the province covered the southern slopes of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains. The north-east of the province was occupied by the large Lake Sevan, lying in a deep hollow among the mountains. The climate of the Erivan province was not the same because of the different altitudes above sea level: hot, dry summers and moderately cold winters prevailed in the valleys of the Armenian Highlands, and on many mountain peaks the snow did not melt all year round.

						The inhabitants of the valleys were mainly engaged in agriculture, while in the most arid regions artificial irrigation was used. Mostly wheat, barley, millet, rice (in more humid areas) and cotton were grown. Horticulture and viticulture were also important. Vegetable gardens, as a rule, did not occupy large areas, but the population grew vegetables: cucumbers, melons, onions, in their personal plots for their own consumption. On the plateau and in the mountainous areas, as well as in very arid places, cattle breeding prevailed: the largest number was of sheep and goats, somewhat less of cattle, and in addition, buffaloes, horses, donkeys and camels were bred. Kurds and some Azerbaijanis were engaged in nomadic cattle breeding. The uncultivated areas were mostly covered with steppe vegetation, but there were small areas of forests in the mountains.{"\n\n"}

						Despite the great distance from Central Russia, where almost all large Russian cities were located, a certain cultural connection between Russia and the Armenian nobility arose quite a long time ago. After the annexation of Armenia to the Russian Empire, wealthy Armenian families began to willingly send young people to study at prominent Russian universities. Perceiving the withdrawal from the power of Iran as a stimulus for original development, Armenian public figures tried to create conditions for the consolidation of the people and the revival of the forgotten ancient culture. In Tiflis, which was the center of the Russian governorship in the Caucasus, Armenian publicists from 1846 began to publish national newspapers and magazines: "Caucasus", "Ararat". In 1854 - 1864. the Armenian educational magazine "Northern Lights" ("Yusisapail") was published in Moscow. Researchers noted that the Armenian population of the Erivan province, although the percentage of literacy is inferior to the Russian, is more literate than the Azerbaijani and Kurdish. Such famous literary figures as Khachatur Abovyan, Gabriel Sundukyan, Hovhannes Tumanyan emerged from the Erivan province. In 1878, after the end of the next Russian-Ottoman war, the Ottoman Kars and Childir Sanjaks (provinces), about half of the population of which were Armenians, went to the Russian Empire. In place of these two sandjaks, the Russian authorities established the Kars region, which, along with the Erivan province, became another Russian administrative-territorial unit with a high proportion of Armenians among the total population. In 1880, an Armenian, a descendant of the vassals of Shah Abbas I, who ruled the city of Lori, Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov, by the decree of Emperor Alexander II, was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs of Russia. M. Loris-Melikov drew up the first draft of the Russian constitution, which was supposed to be discussed at a meeting of the highest state officials of the empire. However, the assassination of Alexander II in March 1881 prevented the implementation of constitutional reforms. Alexander III, the son of Alexander II, who inherited the Russian throne, trying to contain the wave of revolutionary sentiments that swept Russia, “froze” all planned liberal reforms and took a course towards strengthening state one-man command, as well as the possible greater cultural unification of the empire's population, subordination of local politics to Russian national values ​​and ideals ... M. Loris-Melikov was dismissed. In the Caucasus, the policy of russification began to be implemented by the chief commander A. Dondukov-Korsukov. Directly in the Erivan province, it was conducted by the governor M. Shalikov, who held this position in 1880 - 1890. Under him, the colonization of Transcaucasia by Russian settlers was intensified. Teaching in Armenian schools was transferred to Russian. The rights of the Armenian Church were limited.

				In connection with the overthrow of the Russian monarchy during the revolution, the Caucasian governorship was transformed into a Special Transcaucasian Committee, subordinate to the Provisional Government, which sat in Petrograd (formerly St. Petersburg) - a collegial body of supreme power, which consisted of representatives of various Russian political parties. In the course of the October Revolution that followed the February Revolution, power in Petrograd was seized by the Communist Party of the Bolsheviks, whose ideology was based on the principles of Marxism. The Bolshevik leadership transferred powers of power both at the all-Russian level and locally, to the people's elected collegial bodies - the soviets (hence: "Soviet power"). In the Transcaucasian soviets, however, most of the seats were occupied not by the Bolsheviks, but by their former comrades-in-arms - the Mensheviks (Marxists who advocated less radical transformations), the Armenian Dashnaktsutyun, the Azerbaijani Musavat (a national-bourgeois party somewhat close to the Ottoman Young Turks) and non-party deputies. On the basis of the former Special Transcaucasian Committee, a new body of supreme power in the region was established - the Transcaucasian Commissariat. In December 1917, a truce was concluded between the Russian and Ottoman troops, which essentially meant the final withdrawal of Russia from the war and the withdrawal of regular army units. To prevent the invasion of Ottoman troops into Eastern Armenia, through the efforts of the new authorities and Armenian public organizations, a professionally trained and organized Armenian volunteer corps was created under the command of Foma Nazarbekov. In February 1918, a meeting of delegates from different regions of the region convened by the Transcaucasian Commissariat was held in Tiflis. The result was the creation of the independent Transcaucasian Democratic Federal Republic on April 22. However, the contradictions between the peoples living in Transcaucasia and different political parties turned out to be very deep and strong. As a result, the Transcaucasian Federation existed for only a month and split into three states: the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the Georgian Democratic Republic and the Republic of Armenia, whose borders roughly corresponded to the borders of the former Erivan province. The first Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on May 28, 1918 and became the first sovereign Armenian state in Transcaucasia over the past five centuries. Most of the leading positions in it were held by members of the Dashnaktsutyun. It also did not last long: in 1920, in response to an attempt by its troops to recapture Western Armenia, the Ottoman army invaded its borders and began to rapidly seize the territory. In response to a call for help from some politicians in the Republic of Armenia, units of the Red Army, the armed forces created by the Russian Bolshevik government, arrived from Russia. Local Bolsheviks were brought to power in Armenia, who proclaimed the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR). On October 13, 1921, a border treaty was signed between the ASSR and the Ottoman side with the participation of Soviet Russia. According to him, the Ottomans renounced claims on the territory of Eastern Armenia, in turn, the ASSR renounced claims to the former Western Armenia, in which there was almost no Armenian population left anyway. The territory of the former Kars region, which for some time was part of the Russian Empire, also withdrew to the Ottoman side. On March 12, 1922, the Bolsheviks, by that time already brought to power by the Red Army in all the states of the Transcaucasus, proclaimed the creation of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Socialist Republic (TSFSR), which included the Armenian SSR. On December 30 of the same year, the ZSFSR became part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) - a vast federation of Bolshevik state formations that arose in most of the former provinces of the Russian Empire. The armed resistance of the Dashnaks and other national parties of Transcaucasia was suppressed by the Bolsheviks. In 1936, the ZSFSR, like the Transcaucasian Federation earlier, was divided into three equal union republics within the USSR: the Azerbaijan, Georgian and Armenian SSR. However, the rise in political status did not mean at all for Armenia the acquisition of complete political independence. On the contrary, in subsequent years, the power of the supreme leadership of the USSR continued to be strengthened and the total dictatorship of the Communist Party continued. Only on August 23, 1990, the Armenian state, under the renewed name of the Republic of Armenia, again proclaimed full state sovereignty, politically confirmed in connection with the collapse of the USSR on December 26, 1991.
